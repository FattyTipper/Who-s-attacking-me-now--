Checks for other services (Apache, su failures …)

Add nmap functionality, option to nmap ip address of ‘attackers’ Check legalities*
Make script installable.
Investigate whether load balancers affect socket.gethostbyname() – are we getting the server IP or the loadbalancer IP?
Add support for different OSs
Add support for different logs- i.e. Webservers
Create a list of passwrods used and diff against known wordlists
Create a list of comomn usernames diff against them
Create an aleart feature if these are different i.e. breached datdbases and those non-standard creds used
